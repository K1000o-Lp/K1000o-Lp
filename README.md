## FullStack Developer | System Engineer

Hello! I'm Camilo L√≥pez, a system engineering enthusiast with a passion for designing and developing applications. With **11 months of experience** in full-stack development, I love coding and finding the best solutions. My goal is to acquire more experience and expand my knowledge.

Currently, I work as a üíª FullStack Developer at Maracaibo's courthouse, where I provide solutions to existing systems and create new programs for the administrative and criminal areas. In my free time, I enjoy playing üéÆ video games and engaging in self-learning ‚úçÔ∏è about technology.
